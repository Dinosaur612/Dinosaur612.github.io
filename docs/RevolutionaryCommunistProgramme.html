    <h2>Section 1: For Communism</h2>
    <p>Communism, or socialism, is, first of all, not just a change of management as so many renegades of all stripes believe it to be. Nor is it some kind of utopia free of any and all problems, like so many anti-communists think.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Communist society is the material human community, finally realized. The communist movement is the movement "which abolishes the present state of things."
    <p></p>  
    <p>The best definition of the communist mode of production is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All private property (property owned by individuals or collectively in the case of co-ops, utilized for the extraction of surplus value from workers for profit, usually via wages; this does not include your toothbrush) is abolished.</li>
      <li>Markets (places where buyers and sellers exchange commodities, products produced for and distributed based upon exchange value) too are abolished.</li>
      <li>Commodity production (production of goods for exchange value, aka commodities) is abolished.</li>
      <li>Exchange-value itself is done away with.</li>
      <li>Class is abolished (class is a group’s relation to the means of production, as everybody relates to them the same, there is no class).</li>
      <li>The system of wage-labour is abolished.</li>
      <li>Money (as labour vouchers, which appear under lower-phase communism, aka socialism, do not circulate; they are not money) is abolished.</li>
      <li>Organization of society based upon free association (which, as defined by Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness is “The idea that you don’t have to associate with someone if you don’t want to. It means that you don’t have to be part of a specific culture or group if you don’t want to. It means that, rather than trying to reach a worldwide consensus, people with different opinions can go their own ways.”</li>
      <li>Distribution of goods based upon need in higher phase communism and contribution in lower phase communism (socialism).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Section 2: For Internationalism</h2>
    <p>As communists, we are also internationalists. Internationalism is the rejection of nations, nationalism (this includes “the right of nations to self determination” and “national liberation”, whether ethnic, national, etc), patriotism, etc. Internationalists support the abolition of nations and do not support wars between any bourgeois faction of any conflict, whether Stalinist, Fascist, or Liberal. Instead of “critical support” for the “lesser evil” during a war, we propose revolutionary defeatist action against one’s own government.</p>
