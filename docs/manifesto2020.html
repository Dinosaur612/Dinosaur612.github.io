<h2>The Russian Revolution</h2>
<p>We hold that the Russian Revolution was of a proletarian nature and that its degradation was not due to the presence of a vanguard, but due to the isolation of the revolution caused by the failures of other proletarian movements to survive.</p>
<h2>For Collective Management During the Revolutionary Period</h2>
<p>We believe that, during the revolutionary period, industry should be managed by the workers themselves, and not a representative entity acting on their behalf. We emphasize the necessity of the soviets for management of the economy, politics, and everyday life, through a national soviet during the proletarian class dictatorship.</p>
<h2>Against Work</h2>
<p>Under communism, should workers manage the means of production and society as a whole? No. Under communism, there would be no workers. Work as we recognize it disappears under communism, along with the division of labour and of coercion to work.</p>
<h2>For Internationalism</h2>
<p>We as communists do not support national entities. We are internationalists because the proletariat itself is an international class, not bound to any country. We do not support any side in any war between bourgeois nations, and we support the international struggle of the proletariat for its emancipation.</p>
<h2>For the Soviets and the Vanguard</h2>
<p>The Soviets (workers’ councils), born and developed out of the class struggle, are necessary for both the revolution and the proletarian dictatorship. Nothing can replace them as the sole holder of governmental power during the proletarian dictatorship. The role of the vanguard is to provide the class with a revolutionary Programme developed by the most class conscious elements of the class.</p>
<h2>For Centralization</h2>
<p>As a left-communist organization, we reject decentralization as a viable method of organizing the International Party and the workers’ councils. Although it may sound nice on paper, how do you defend yourself against the armies of the bourgeoisie without a centralized power? Simple: you can’t, not easily at least. This is why we support centralization, as it allows for a proletarian dictatorship to more easily defend itself against enemies of all sorts, and abolish capitalism.</p>
<h2>Against Leftism</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be a leftist? Is it to be an anti-capitalist? Why then, are social democrats, Stalinists, and market “socialists” of all flavours considered leftist when all they desire is changing how capital is managed? The obvious answer is: leftism is bourgeois! The genuine anti-capitalists are not leftists, but communists, who form a separate entity from the left and their politics.</p>
<h2>Against the Unions</h2>
<p>With the on-going decay of capital, unions have been absorbed into capitalism and are nothing but a tool of the capitalist class to suppress workers’ resistance, by serving as cul-de-sacs for proletarian resistance to capitalism. Unions, with their bureaucracies, and “union approval” for strikes must be opposed by communists. They only limit the autonomy and freedom of the working class and keep the class struggle on a short leash.</p>
<h2>Against Both Fascism & Anti-Fascism</h2>
<p>We are opposed to fascism and anti-fascism and desire a fight against both. Historically, anti-fascism has been utilized to justify mass slaughters of the proletariat, such as WW2, with Stalin calling Russian workers together to slaughter German workers in the name of anti-fascism. Anti-fascists usually support united fronts with liberals and the “democratic” or “good” bourgeois, dividing the proletariat and mobilizing it against a “bad” bourgeois, of course, in reality, no faction of the bourgeois is good.</p>
<h2>Against Parliament, for the Class Struggle</h2>
<p>The methods of governmental reform with the objective of achieving socialism are flawed and have proven themselves to be ineffective. Communists who enter government are invariably assimilated into the bourgeoisie, and even if they retain their class consciousness and radical politics, it is impossible to beat capitalism with an institution it created.</p>
<h2>The Imperialist Era</h2>
<p>Since the 20th century’s beginning, all wars have been imperialist wars, part of the deadly clash between nations large and small to retain or gain a spot in the international arena. These wars, of course, cause massive death to humanity and the environment on increasing scales. The proletariat can only respond to them through banding together and fighting against the international bourgeoisie.</p>
<h2>Against National Liberation and Self-Determination</h2>
<p>All nationalist/patriotic ideologies – ‘national liberation, ‘the right of nations to self-determination’, etc. – whether ethnic, historical, or religious, are poisonous for the working class. By calling on workers to take the side of a faction of the bourgeoisie, they divide workers and lead them to massacre each other in the interests and wars of their exploiters.</p>
<h2>Against Civilization</h2>
<p>Civilization is “A culture — that is, a complex of stories, institutions, and artifacts — that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities (civilization, see civil: from civis, meaning citizen, from Latin civitatis, meaning city-state).” It develops contradictorily and relies on the exploitation of one class by another to exist, just like the state does. Not only does it do so but it alienates people from nature.</p>
<h2>Against School</h2>
<p>School, a system of education? No. It is a system of torment! School is a drag on everyone’s mental health, it encourages students to compete against each other rather than cooperate. School, specifically the Prussian system we all experience, was designed to produce good factory workers, not to educate children.</p>
