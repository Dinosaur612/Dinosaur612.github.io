    <h2>Section 1: For Communism</h2>
    <p>Communism, or socialism, is, first of all, not just a change of management as so many renegades of all stripes believe it to be. Nor is it some kind of utopia free of any and all problems, like so many anti-communists think.</p>
    <p>Communist society is the material human community, finally realized. The communist movement is the movement "which abolishes the present state of things."
    <p>The best definition of the communist mode of production is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All private property (property owned by individuals or collectively in the case of co-ops, utilized for the extraction of surplus value from workers for profit, usually via wages; this does not include your toothbrush) is abolished.</li>
      <li>Markets (places where buyers and sellers exchange commodities, products produced for and distributed based upon exchange value) too are abolished.</li>
      <li>Commodity production (production of goods for exchange value, aka commodities) is abolished.</li>
      <li>Exchange-value itself is done away with.</li>
      <li>Class is abolished (class is a group’s relation to the means of production, as everybody relates to them the same, there is no class).</li>
      <li>The system of wage-labour is abolished.</li>
      <li>Money (as labour vouchers, which appear under lower-phase communism, aka socialism, do not circulate; they are not money) is abolished.</li>
      <li>Organization of society based upon free association (which, as defined by Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness is “The idea that you don’t have to associate with someone if you don’t want to. It means that you don’t have to be part of a specific culture or group if you don’t want to. It means that, rather than trying to reach a worldwide consensus, people with different opinions can go their own ways.”</li>
      <li>Distribution of goods based upon need in higher phase communism and contribution in lower phase communism (socialism).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Section 2: For Internationalism</h2>
    <p>Very briefly, internationalism is the abolition of nations. Internationalists reject bourgeois war and peace, instead proposing revolutionary defeatist action against one's own government, support a international revolution and denounce the Stalinist betrayal of "Socialism in one Country", which abandons the international struggle of the proletariat and the proletariat itself by confusing its goals with the bourgeois concept of nations.</p>
    <h2>Section 3: For Revolution</h2>
    <h2>Section 4: For the Proletarian Dictatorship</h2>
      <h2>Section 5: For Centralism</h2>
     <h2>Section 6: For the Party</h2>
    <a id="what_we_are_against"><h1>Chapter 3: What We Are Against</h1></a>
    <h2>Section 1: Outside and Against the Unions</h2>
    <h2>Section 2: Against Parliamentarism</h2>
  <h2>Section 3: Against the Left</h2>
<h2>Section 4: Against Fascism & Anti-Fascism</h2>
    <h2>Section 5: Against the Lies of “Actually Existing Socialism”</h2>
<h2>Section 6: Against Work</h2>
<h2>Section 7: Against Civilization</h2>
    <h2>Section 8: Against the Family</h2>
    <h2>Section 9: Against Armies and Law Enforcement</h2>
<h2>Section 10: Against National Liberation</h2>
    <h2>Section 11: Against Egalitarianism</h2>
    <p>Egalitarianism is the belief in the abstract (impossible) notion of "equality" and supporting achieving it. It is abstract because it is very open to interpretation. It is impossible because one form of equality will lead to inequality in other ways, such as if workers were all paid the same for the same hours of work (equality of pay), workers who work more get more money, and those with families have less for themselves, while a worker without a family has more. As Marxists, we support human freedom and human development. We do not support socialism because it is egalitarian, but because of the fact it leads to human freedom and development.</p>
